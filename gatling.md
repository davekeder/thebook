Dear Sir

In reply to your inquiry of the 14th, regarding the number of shots per minute of my Gun & the number of patents taken out, I would say – that the gun, when operated by hand, will fire over 1,200 shots per minute, but when revolved by an Electric Motor which has recently been applied to the gun – it will fire at the rate of 3,000 per minute.

I have taken out for improvements on the gun & for the different feeds, 7 patents.

Enclosed, is an article covering the latest feed improvements in the gun.

Yours respectfully,
R. J. Gatling
(Dictated)

## 📚 Richard J. Gatling

**Richard Jordan Gatling (1818–1903)** was an American inventor best known for developing the **Gatling gun**, one of the first successful rapid-fire weapons. Patented in 1862 during the American Civil War, the Gatling gun used multiple rotating barrels to achieve a high rate of fire, greatly advancing battlefield technology.

Gatling’s innovation was driven by a desire to reduce the size of armies and minimize combat deaths by making warfare so deadly that it would discourage future conflicts. Despite this humanitarian motivation, the Gatling gun was used extensively in conflicts worldwide, revolutionizing modern warfare. By the time of this 1893 letter, Gatling had refined his original invention by incorporating an electric motor, increasing the firing rate to a staggering **3,000 shots per minute**, a remarkable feat for the era.
