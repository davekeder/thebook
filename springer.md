House of Representatives U.S.
Washington, D.C., Sept. 1st, '93.

Mr. C. W. Mills,
Sodus, N. Y.,
My dear Sir:-

Your letter of the 30th ultimo is duly received.

I would not advise you to begin the study of law at your age, 16 years. You should first lay a broad foundation, which can be done by entering college and graduating in the classical department of a first class university. You will then be in a position to take up a course in the law schools. To begin the study of law at your age would be like building a palace upon a foundation of sand. The successful lawyer ought to be an educated gentleman. There is more in the duties of the profession than can be obtained from law books.

I am,
Very truly yours,

Wm. M. Springer

## 📚 William M. Springer

**William McKendree Springer (1836–1903)** was a U.S. Congressman from Illinois who served in the House of Representatives from 1875 to 1895. He was a prominent member of the Democratic Party and chaired several influential committees during his tenure, including the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Banking and Currency.

Springer was known for his advocacy of progressive legislation, including support for the free coinage of silver and opposition to monopolistic practices. He was also an advocate of Native American rights and contributed to the passage of the **Dawes Act** in 1887, which aimed to assimilate Native Americans by allocating land to individual tribal members.

This letter, dated **September 1, 1893**, reflects Springer’s emphasis on a strong educational foundation for aspiring professionals. He advises a young man, **C. W. Mills**, to pursue a classical education before attempting the study of law, suggesting that building a legal career without a solid foundation would be akin to “building a palace upon a foundation of sand.”
