    <strong>Grover Cleveland (1837–1908)</strong> was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, serving two non-consecutive terms from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897, making him the only U.S. president to achieve this feat until Donald Trump in 2024. In 1893, at the start of his second term, Cleveland was 56 years old, returning to the White House after defeating Benjamin Harrison in the 1892 election. A Democrat known for his honesty and fiscal conservatism, Cleveland faced immense challenges during his second term, including the Panic of 1893, which triggered a severe economic depression with widespread unemployment and business failures. His decision to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which he blamed for the economic crisis, split the Democratic Party, alienating western and southern Democrats who favored free silver. Cleveland also intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike, sending federal troops to Chicago to break the strike, a move that angered labor unions but earned him support from the business community. Despite his unpopularity by the end of his term, Cleveland’s commitment to limited government and anti-corruption principles left a lasting legacy as a principled leader during the Gilded Age.
