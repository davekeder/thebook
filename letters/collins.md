## üìö Eddie Collins

**Edward Trowbridge Collins Sr. (1887‚Äì1951)**, commonly known as Eddie Collins, was a legendary American baseball player, manager, and executive, widely regarded as one of the greatest second basemen in the history of Major League Baseball. Born in Millerton, New York, Collins played college baseball at Columbia University before beginning his professional career in 1906 with the Philadelphia Athletics, where he became a key member of Connie Mack‚Äôs championship teams, winning four World Series titles (1910, 1911, 1913, and 1929). Known for his exceptional hitting, speed, and defensive skills, Collins amassed 3,315 hits over his 25-year playing career, which also included stints with the Chicago White Sox, and he was a member of the infamous 1919 "Black Sox" team, though he was not implicated in the scandal. After retiring as a player, Collins transitioned into management and executive roles, serving as the general manager of the Boston Red Sox from 1933 until 1947, a period during which he helped rebuild the team under owner Tom Yawkey, laying the groundwork for future success, including the acquisition of players like Ted Williams. Collins was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939, cementing his legacy as one of baseball‚Äôs all-time greats.

This letter, dated **July 15, 1933**, captures a personal exchange between **C. W. Mills**, a resident of Sodus, New York, and Eddie Collins, who had recently become the general manager of the Boston Red Sox. Written on official Red Sox letterhead from Fenway Park, the letter responds to Mills‚Äô earlier correspondence, which included clippings about fishing in Sarasota and a snapshot of Mills with six tarpon he had caught. Collins expresses his admiration for Mills‚Äô fishing success and extends good wishes on behalf of himself and Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, even proposing a future fishing session together. The letter reflects a later chapter in Mills‚Äô life, showcasing his continued habit of corresponding with prominent figures.
