## 📚 John Russell Young

**John Russell Young (1840–1899)** was an American journalist, diplomat, and government official, whose career spanned war correspondence, international diplomacy, and cultural preservation, making him a notable figure in late 19th-century American history. Born on November 20, 1840, in County Tyrone, Ireland, Young immigrated to the United States as a child and grew up in Philadelphia, where he began his career in journalism at the age of 16. During the Civil War, he served as a war correspondent for the *Philadelphia Press*, earning acclaim for his vivid reporting from the front lines, and later managed the *New York Tribune* under Horace Greeley, becoming a prominent editorial voice during Reconstruction. In 1877, Young accompanied former President Ulysses S. Grant on a two-year world tour, chronicling the journey in his book *Around the World with General Grant* (1879), which solidified his reputation as a skilled writer and observer of global affairs.

Young’s diplomatic career began in 1882 when President Chester A. Arthur appointed him U.S. Minister to China, a role he held until 1885, during which he navigated complex U.S.-China relations amid tensions over immigration and trade, including the aftermath of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. After returning to the U.S., he continued his journalism career, founding the *Philadelphia Evening Star* and serving as a correspondent for the *New York Herald*. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed Young as Librarian of Congress, a position he held until his death in 1899, where he oversaw the library’s transition into its new Jefferson Building and expanded its collections, leaving a lasting legacy in American cultural institutions. Young was also a member of the Union League of Philadelphia, a prestigious club founded to support the Union cause, where he wrote this letter during a visit in 1894.

This letter, dated January 27, 1894, was written from the Union League in Philadelphia, a social and political hub for prominent figures, where Young was serving as president of the club from 1892 to 1895, reflecting his leadership among the city’s elite. Addressed to C.W. Mills, the letter responds to Mills’ inquiry about the authorship of a specific phrase, with Young stating, “I am not the author of the phrase referred to in your letter.” At the time, Young was 53 years old and between his major appointments, having recently returned from China and not yet appointed Librarian of Congress, likely focusing on his journalism career in Philadelphia. The letter captures a moment of correspondence during Mills’ 1893–1894 campaign to collect letters and signatures from notable figures, and Young’s polite but brief response reflects his engagement with such requests from the public. Young continued to influence journalism and public service until his death on January 17, 1899, in Washington, D.C., leaving behind a legacy as a bridge between journalism, diplomacy, and cultural preservation in a transformative era of American history.
