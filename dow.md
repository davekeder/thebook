Portland, 8 June 1893

Dear Sir,

The time has not yet arrived when any well-formed opinion can be entertained or publicly expressed as to the future of the Prohibition Party, nor as to the wisest and best nominations for candidates that can be offered.

Respectfully,

Neal Dow

## 📚 Neal Dow

**Neal Dow (1804–1897)**, often called the "Father of Prohibition," was a pivotal figure in the American temperance movement, born on March 20, 1804, in Portland, Maine, to a Quaker family. His early exposure to the societal ills of alcohol—witnessed through his role as Portland’s overseer of the poor and the rampant drunkenness of the era—fueled his lifelong crusade against liquor. Dow’s activism began in earnest when he helped found the Maine Temperance Union in 1838, and as mayor of Portland in 1851, he authored the Maine Law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that banned the sale and production of alcohol in the state, signed into law on June 2, 1851. This law became a model for other states and a precursor to national Prohibition, earning Dow the nickname "Napoleon of Temperance." His political career, however, was marred by the 1855 Portland Rum Riot, where his order to fire on a protesting crowd resulted in one death and several injuries, damaging his reputation and leading to the repeal of the Maine Law in 1856. Despite this setback, Dow remained a steadfast advocate, serving as a brigadier general in the Civil War, running as the Prohibition Party’s presidential candidate in 1880 (garnering about 10,000 votes), and continuing to lecture across the U.S., Canada, and Great Britain until his death on October 2, 1897, in Portland.
The letter, written on June 8, 1893, reflects Dow’s ongoing commitment to the Prohibition Party late in his life, at the age of 89. In it, he expresses a cautious stance on the party’s future and its candidate nominations, indicating his continued engagement with the temperance movement even as national Prohibition remained elusive—still 26 years away with the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919. Dow’s house in Portland, built in 1829, became a hub for temperance activities and is now a National Historic Landmark, housing the Maine Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. His autobiography, The Reminiscences of Neal Dow: Recollections of Eighty Years (1898), offers a firsthand account of his efforts, though his legacy is complex: while celebrated for his moral conviction, his heavy-handed tactics and the ultimate failure of Prohibition highlight the challenges of legislating morality, a debate that continues to resonate in discussions of personal liberty versus societal good.
